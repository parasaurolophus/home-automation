      outside the home[<sup>*</sup>](#https)
  - No additional servers or services required other than those provided
    by the Hue and PowerView hubs
- Consolidated dashboard / web-based UI using
  [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)/[Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/)
  - Requires separate build step after cloning repo from
    GitHub[<sup>**</sup>](#plainhtml5)
- Time and date based automation
  - Turn on and off lights based on local sunrise / sunset
  - Use special occasion lighting themes based on date
  - Open and close window coverings based on sun's local altitude and
    azimuth on any given day

out the HTTPS related configuration from _~/.node-red/settings.js_. Detailed
instructions for obtaining and installing certificates and configuring IP
reservations and port forwarding on routers are beyond the scope of this README.

<a id="plainhtml5"></a> <sup>**</sup>An earlier version of this project
implemented the dashboard using pure HTML 5 / JavaScript for its dashboard which
did not have additional build steps. I admit it. I was led astray by the pretty

## About

These flows implement more sophisticated time-based
automation than is supported directly by popular home
automation platforms like Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa,
Google Home, Samsung SmartThings, etc., or the native
apps supplied by Philips and Hunter-Douglas. For example,
they activate different seasonal lighting themes
automatically based on the date. They also drive window
shade automation based on the sun's position over the
course of a day based on the geographic location of the
home and the day of the year.

## Configuration

These flows require some specific configuration in
_settings.js_. To facilitate documenting and sharing
these options, the following assumes that these
secctions of _settings.js_ are defined using `require`
rather than by directly embedded JavaScript objects:

- `contextStorage`
- `projects`
- An entry in the `httpStatic` array
- A set of environment variable definitions

This is accomplished by creating a number of separate
JavaScript files and referencing them from `settings.js`
by placing the following just above (not inside)
`module.exports`:

```javascript
var environment = require('./environment')
var dashboardPath = require('./dashboardPath')
var contextStorage = require('./contextStorage')
var projects = require('./projects')
```

Each of these JavaScript files consists of its own
`module.exports` statement, described below.

### _environment.js_

Placing the following line above `module.exports` in
_settings.js_ loads the contents of _environment.js_ as
a module:

```javascript
var environment = require('./environment')
```

The _environment.js_ file contains definitions of
environment variables assumed by various function nodes
and subflows. Here is an example of what it should look
contain:

```javascript
module.exports = {

    // change these to the latitude and longitude
    // of your home
    latitude: process.env.LATITUDE = '42.1967',
    longitude: process.env.LONGITUDE = '-90.0382',

    // change these to the IP address and access token
    // of your Hue Bridge
    ground_floor_hue_address: process.env.GROUND_FLOOR_HUE_ADDRESS = '192.168.1.40',
    ground_floor_hue_key: process.env.GROUND_FLOOR_HUE_KEY = 'FiLAHkz6wMwa-3bz06K9a8MLfCaSSzR5WxSK8a-y',

    // you can define multiple Hue Bridge configurations
    basement_hue_address: process.env.BASEMENT_HUE_ADDRESS = '192.168.1.41',
    basement_hue_key: process.env.BASEMENT_HUE_KEY = '-7bz1KHa9Lde2QV00yBYQ75bo6hlVBN2mopvXnrNa',

    // change this to the IP address of your PowerView hub
    powerview_address: process.env.POWERVIEW_ADDRESS = '192.168.1.42',

    // don't use "localhost" inside Node-RED due to a bug
    // introduced by Node.js >= 18
    //
    // also, if you have TLS / SSL enabled elsewhere
    // in settings.js, use wss:// here and you will
    // then probably have to use the DNS name in your
    // certificate instead of an IP address
    broker_url: process.env.BROKER_URL = 'ws://127.0.0.1:1880/broker',

}
```

| Environment Variable       | Description                                                                          |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `LATITUDE`                 | Coordinate for use with [suncalc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/suncalc)             |
| `LONGITUDE`                | Coordinate for use with [suncalc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/suncalc)             |
| `GROUND_FLOOR_HUE_ADDRESS` | IP address of the Hue Bridge controlling devices on the ground floor                 |
| `GROUND_FLOOR_HUE_KEY`     | API access token for the ground floor Hue Bridge                                     |
| `BASEMENT_HUE_ADDRESS`     | IP address of the Hue Bridge controlling devices in the basement                     |
| `BASEMENT_HUE_KEY`         | API access token for the basement Hue Bridge                                         |
| `POWERVIEW_ADDRESS`        | IP address of the PowerView hub                                                      |
| `BROKER_URL`               | The URL to use to when connecting as a client to the WebSocket served by these flows |

### _contextStorage.js_

Placing the following above `module.exports` in
_settings.js_ set the value of a variable named
`contextStorage` to the JavaScript object defined by a
module in _contextStorage.js_:

```javascript
var contextStorage = require('./contextStorage')
```

That file contains:

```javascript
module.exports = {

    default: { module: 'memory' },
    file: { module: 'localfilesystem' }

}
```

To be effective, the corresponding `contextStorage:`
section in _settings.js_ must reference the global
variable:

```javascript
/** Context Storage
 * The following property can be used to enable context storage. The configuration
 * provided here will enable file-based context that flushes to disk every 30 seconds.
 * Refer to the documentation for further options: https://nodered.org/docs/api/context/
 */
contextStorage: contextStorage,
```

The preceding adds a file-system backed context store
named `file` to the default in-memory context store.

### _projects.js_

Placing the following above `module.exports` in
_settings.js_ set the value of a variable named
`projects` to the JavaScript object defined by a
module in _projects.js_:

```javascript
var projects = require('./projects')
```

That file contains:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    /** To enable the Projects feature, set this value to true */
    enabled: true,
    workflow: {
        /** Set the default projects workflow mode.
         *  - manual - you must manually commit changes
         *  - auto - changes are automatically committed
         * This can be overridden per-user from the 'Git config'
         * section of 'User Settings' within the editor
         */
        mode: "manual"
    }
}
```

To be effective, the corresponding `projects:`
subsection inside the `editorTheme` section in
_settings.js_ must reference the global variable:

```javascript
projects: projects,
```

The preceding enables the `git` based projects features
in the Node-RED editor and sets the workflow option to
"manual" (the default).

### _dashboardPath.js_

Placing the following above `module.exports` in
_settings.js_ set the value of a variable named
`dashboardPath` to the JavaScript object defined by a
module in _dashboardPath.js_:

```javascript
var dashboardPath = require('./dashboardPath')
```

That file contains:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    // change "nodereduser" to the name of the user
    // as which the Node-RED service runs
    path: '/home/nodereduser/.node-red/projects/home-automation/dashboard/dist/',
    root: "/dashboard/"
}
```

This module definitions assumes that the value of the
`httpStatic:` section of _settings.js_ will be an array,
and that the value of the global `dashboardPath` variable
will be one of its values:

```javascript
httpStatic: [
    dashboardPath,
    // additional static paths, if desired...
],
```

## Installation

0. (Optional) Install your desired version of _Node_,
   e.g. using the
   [nodesource](https://nodesource.com/)
   repository for your host platform (make sure to choose a
   version that is compatible with your target version of
   Node-RED 3.0 or later)

1. Install Node-RED 3.0 or later as per
   <https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/>
   (if you skipped step 0 then the standard install script
   for Debian based hosts will attempt to install or
   upgrade _Node_ if no compatible version is found but then
   you may be left with a version of _Node_ that is behind
   the current LTS)

2. Install the [dependencies described below](#dependencies)

3. Create the settings module files and modify _settings.js_
   as described above; modify the contents of the settings
   module files as appropriate for your local environment

4. Restart the Node-RED process

5. Create a copy of
   <https://github.com/parasaurolophus/home-automation>
   so that you can easily customize your configuration and
   use Git to safely manage it (you can, of course, create
   a fork but pull requests that include changes to the
   home automation configuration will be rejected)

6. Use Node-RED's "open project" feature to clone your
   copied repository into your local project folder

7. In a terminal,
   ```bash
   cd ~/.node-red/projects/home-automation/dashboard
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
   to create the
   _~/.node-red/projects/home-automation/dashboard/dist_ directory

If all goes well, opening the Node-RED editor will allow
you to examine and modify these flows. Browsing to your
Node-RED instance's URL with _/dashboard_ added to the end
will open the [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) based
dashboard. Note that you will have to edit the contents of
the _Automation_ and _Hue_ flows to match your hardware
setup and scene configuration in order for the Hue controls
to be generated on the dashboard and the time and date based
lighting and window shade automations to have the intended
effect.

## Dependencies

The following node packages must be installed before
loading these flows into your environment:

- [@parasaurolophus/node-red-dnssd](https://flows.nodered.org/node/@parasaurolophus/node-red-dnssd)
- [@parasaurolophus/node-red-eventsource](https://flows.nodered.org/node/@parasaurolophus/node-red-eventsource)

In addition, some `function` nodes in these flows load the
[suncalc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/suncalc) package
dynamically, which must be enabled in _settings.js_
(true by default).

## Features

- Local control of Philips Hue lighting and Hunter-Douglas
  (PowerView) window coverings using the API's provided by
  their respective hubs

- Dynamically created dashboard controls for individual
  device groups and scenes created by querying the Hue and
  PowerView hubs

- Home automation driven by date, time and the position of
  the sun   over the course of each day of the year

- Support multiple Hue hubs concurrently

The implementation of these  features provides practical
demonstrations of a number of basic software-engineering
concepts such as event-driven programming and data-driven
user interfaces using the "Model - View - Controller"
(MVC) design pattern. It also serves as a repository of
examples of a number of techniques specific to Node-RED as a
home automation platform and how it interoperates with
underlying technologies such as WebSockets, JavaScript
embedded in HTML and so on.

### Requirements

The goals for these flows include:

1. More sophisticated automation rules than supported
   directly by the native apps and off-the-shelf "smart
   home" platforms supplied by companies like Philips,
   Hunter-Douglas, Apple, Google, Amazon, Samsung etc.

2. Support a consolidated user interface easily accessible
   by anyone in the home, including guests, without having
   to own a specific make of mobile device, install
   specific apps or create accounts with
   any so-called "cloud services"

3. Eliminate the use of third-party "clouds" to the
   greatest degree possible due to performance,
   reliability, security and privacy concerns

The home in question has a number of "smart" devices from
multiple manufacturers, none of which come with any ability
to interoperate directly with one another. Home automation
platforms from companies like Apple, Google and Amazon are
woefully inadequate in many respects, and each requires
anyone attempting to do things as simple as turning on and
off lights to have a specific app, with a properly
configured account, with that account given pretty much
_carte blanche_ authority to do anything it likes to every
aspect of the "smart" home, mediated by "cloud services"
owned and operated by third-parties with their own agendas
that trump any consideration of their customers'
convenience, security or privacy.

Using Node-RED allows for a fairly intuitive user interface
that can be accessed with no more specialized an app than a
web browser. Further, Node-RED can be programmed to do
anything that can be accomplished in a general-purpose
programming language, JavaScript, rather than being
constrained by the features made available at the whim of
companies more interested in extending their surveillance
and control over their "walled gardens" (which they regard
as including their customers' homes and personal property)
than in providing useful products and services.

### User interface

> _**Warning!** There is a build step required after
> cloning the repository for these flows in order for the
> dashboard to be  available at
>`https://<nodered-host>:1880/dashboard`_
>
> ```bash
> cd ~/.node-red/projects/home-automation/dashboard
> npm install
> npm run build
>```
>
> _This invokes the Vue / Vuetify "tooling" to create the
> contents of the _dist_ directory referenced by the
> `httpStatic` setting
> [described above](#static-http-content)._

These Node-RED flows do not directly implement any user interface.
Instead, they asynchronously send event messages
and receive command messages using a WebSocket node
configured to "listen to" the URI `/broker`. In addition to
and separate from _flows.json_, the GitHub repository for
these flows includes a subdirectory, _dashboard_, which
implements a "single page web application" that connects to
the `/broker` WebSocket listener in Node-RED and presents a
user inteface composed of
[Vuetify 3](https://vuetifyjs.com/) components. They make
extensive use of [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org) features to
implement a highly reactive user interface that
automatically adapts to configuration changes made in the
Hue and PowerView native apps.

This allows for a nearly complete separation between the
_view_ implemented using [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/),
the _model_ transmitted as JSON message payloads using
WebSockets, and Node-RED flows as the _controller_ in the
so-called MVC (Model, View, Controller) architectural
pattern. The result is that these flows display a
consolidated user interface for controlling diverse devices
from multiple vendors without having to be edited whenever
those devices' configuration is changed in their respective
native apps. They do this using features directly supported
by modern web browsers without requiring the intermingling
of front-end and back-end logic directly within the
Node-RED flows. This is why these flows have no dependency
on _node-red-dashboard_ nor any of the community supplied
packages intended to replace it. All of the functionality
that would be supplied by any such package is entirely
encapsulated within the _dashboard/dist_ directory that
must be built after downloading this repository from
GitHub. With the appropriate configuration of _settings.js_
as [described above](#dashboardPath.js), you can access
_dashboard/dist/index.html_ using Node-RED's built-in web
server and the web page will automatically deduce the
correct URL with which to connect to the `/broker`
WebSocket server implemented by these flows.

The reason for this strict separation between view and
controller is not a dogmatic adherence to theoretical purity
in the domain of software architecture. The sad truth is
that while Node-RED greatly benefits from the culture of an
open source community, it also suffers from the
inevitable shortcomings of all such products. (This is not
unique to Node-RED nor even to open source software: the
many challenges of relying on any open source product is a
specific example of the general
[tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons)
about which political and economic theorists have written
for centuries.) The _node-red-dashboard_ component,
supplied by Node-RED's core development team, suffers from
the kind of "bit rot" that always -- no, really, _always_
-- infects open source projects' repositories while
community-supplied components vary widely in their quality.
Support by their authors is often intermittent and
ephemeral. That is why these flows are designed to rely on
as few add-on components as possible. They use core nodes
such as `function` and `http request` to utilize the various
device API's directly rather than using node packages that
wrap them because this reduces exposure to defects and
deficiencies in third-party components. The critical
bits of functionality that are implemented as community
supplied node packages were created by the same author for
the specific needs of accessing the Philips Hue Bridge SSE
API from within these flows.

(The author feels confident in sufficiently prompt and
diligent responses to bug reports and feature requests he
makes to himself, while having no illusions nor
unreasonable expectations regarding the priority such issues
would be given by someone else who created some similar
package for their own purposes, who knows how long ago, and
then moved on to who knows what other projects and
interests.)

Note that once built, the _dashboard/dist_ directory
contains only HTML, JavaScript, CSS and similar standard
web content files. It does not require any special code on
the web server (_Node-RED_, in this case). It uses only
the native WebSocket support built into modern web browsers
to communicate with the Node-RED back end rather than using
a package like _socket.io_. All dynamic rendering is done on
the client side using JavaScript and the DOM API also built
into web browsers. _Vue_ does use certain browser features that
require it to be loaded with a URL beginning with `http://`
or `https://`, but it does not actually rely on any "server
side rendering" code.

> _To emphasize this point, an early version of this
> repository had a version of the dashboard implemented
> without the use of any client-side tooling but, rather,
> hand-crafted HTML, CSS and JavaScript. That version
> worked fine when opened using `file://` URL, i.e. without
> being "served" via HTTP at all. Frameworks like_ Vue /
> Vuetify _provide only "nice to have" features that enhance
> maintainability and readability of the HTML, not
> essential features required for core functionality. To
> be clear, the latter is a feature of such frameworks, not
> a deficiency. By locating front-end concerns entirely on
> the client, a distributed system makes optimal use of
> all the computing and memory resources available to it._

## Theory of Operation

The automation features that are the core of these flows
are implemented as a series of "trigger" events that are
emitted up to six times per day when particular time and
date conditions are met. Each "trigger" event has
`msg.topic` set to `auomtation/trigger` and `msg.payload`
containing a JavaScript object with the following
properties:

| `msg.payload[]`      | Description                                                                                     |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `timer/theme`        | One of the [theme](#theme) values described below                                               |
| `timer/time`         | One of the [time](#time) values described below                                                 |
| `settings/lighting`  | A boolean value indicating whether or not lighting automation has been enabled by a user        |
| `settings/shades`    | A boolean value indicating whether or not window covering automation has been enabled by a user |

The dashboard includes controls for selecting the values for
`msg.payload['settings/lighting']` and
`msg.payload'settings/shades']`.

### Theme

The payload of each `automation/trigger` event has
`msg.payload['timer/theme']` set to one of following values:

| `msg.payload['timer/theme']` | Description                      |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `tribal`                     | July 1 - 4 (US Independence Day) |
| `spooky`                     | Any day in October               |
| `jolly`                      | Any day in December              |
| `standard`                   | Any other day                    |

### Time

The payload of each `automation/trigger` event has
`msg.payload['timer/time']` set to one of the following
values:

| `msg.payload['timer/time']` | Description                                                                                                                          |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sunrise`                   | Sent at sunrise<sup>1</sup>                                                                                                          |
| `midday`                    | Sent if and when the sun first reaches an altitude of 0.9 radians on a given day<sup>2</sup>                                         |
| `afternoon`                 | Sent when the sun first drops below an altitude of 0.9 after it has reached an azimuth greater than 0.0 (i.e. shining from the west) |
| `sunset`                    | Sent at sunset                                                                                                                       |
| `bedtime`                   | Sent at somewhat randomized time each evening<sup>3</sup>                                                                            |

Obviously, the preceding times-of-day rules are designed
for a location in the northern hemisphere, below the arctic
circle. The value of 0.9 radians for the thresholds
defining `midday` and `afternoon` were determined
empirically for a particular home, at a particular latitude,
with eaves of a particular size over windows facing
particular directions. The exact values will need
adjustment based on the circumstances and preferences of
the occupants of some other building at some different
location. The whole approach would have to be different for
locations at sufficiently extreme latitudes that the sun
ever sets later than a desirable bedtime or where days and
nights sometimes last longer than 24 hours.

Whatever the exact values, the goal is to trigger lighting
and window covering automation so as to optimize energy
usage and comfort in the following ways:

- Have the windows uncovered as much of the day as practical
  so as to make the view of the outside world available
- Have only those windows covered at those times of days
  when the sun's angle would cause it to shine too directly
  into the home for comfort and energy efficiency
- Turn on and off lighting as needed for various activities
  based on the times at which the sun rises and sets on any
  given day as well as a desired bedtime
- Have the bedtime lighting and window covering automation
  slightly randomized to provide a degree of simulated
  presence when the home is unoccupied

Notes:

<sup>1</sup> All times of day and sun coordinates are
obtained using
[suncalc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/suncalc) and require that the `${LATITUDE}` and `${LONGITUDE}`
